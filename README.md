# Health Signal Analytics: Smoker Status Classification

This project implements a machine learning-based system to classify smoker status using health signal data. The application provides a web interface for users to input health metrics and receive predictions about smoking status.

## 🚀 Features

- Web-based interface for easy interaction
- Machine learning model for smoker status classification
- Real-time predictions
- User-friendly input form for health metrics
- Responsive design
